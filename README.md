### `04_InsuranceClaimPrediction`
**Goal:** Predict if an insurance claim will be made.  
**Focus:** Risk modeling and classification; working with imbalanced datasets.  
**Techniques:** Random Forest, SMOTE, and hyperparameter tuning.

---

### `05_LoanAcceptancePrediction`
**Goal:** Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a personal loan product.  
**Focus:** End-to-end pipeline with LightGBM, feature engineering, model deployment using **Hugging Face Spaces**.  
**Bonus:** Streamlit web app UI with interactive user inputs.
