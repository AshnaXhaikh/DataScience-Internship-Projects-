# Credit Risk Prediction

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan** using supervised machine learning models. The project focuses on addressing key challenges such as:
- Handling **class imbalance**
- Preventing **model overfitting**
- Ensuring interpretability and performance of the models
