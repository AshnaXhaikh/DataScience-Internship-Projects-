# Credit Risk Prediction

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to **predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan** using supervised machine learning models. The project focuses on addressing key challenges such as:
- Handling **class imbalance**
- Preventing **model overfitting**
- Ensuring interpretability and performance of the models

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Processing:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`  
- **Modeling & Evaluation:** `Scikit-learn`  
- **Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  

Each model was evaluated on classification performance, and insights were derived to recommend the most effective solution.

---

## 📌 Key Contributions

- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Addressed **imbalanced classes** using appropriate techniques
- Built and compared **baseline ML models**
- Visualized model performance and insights

---

## 📎 Notes

This project was completed as part of a **Data Science Internship** and serves as a demonstration of predictive modeling skills in a **financial risk context**.

---

## 📂 Future Enhancements

- Add more models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Deploy a basic prediction app using Streamlit
