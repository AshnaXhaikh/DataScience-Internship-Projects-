# 🌸 Iris Dataset Exploration

---

## 🎯 Task Overview

This project focuses on the **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the classic **Iris dataset**, one of the most well-known datasets in pattern recognition and machine learning. The goal was to get hands-on experience with:
- Data loading
- Structural exploration
- Basic visualization techniques

---

## 📋 Task Breakdown

### ✅ Load Dataset
- Loaded the Iris dataset using **Pandas**

### ✅ Data Inspection
- Explored structure with:
  - `.shape` → dataset dimensions  
  - `.columns` → feature names  
  - `.head()` → first few rows

### ✅ Visualizations Created
- 📊 **Scatter Plot**: Showed relationships between different features  
- 📈 **Histogram**: Displayed distribution of each feature  
- 📦 **Box Plot**: Visualized spread and identified outliers

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 📎 Learning Outcomes

- Practiced **EDA fundamentals**
- Gained experience in **data visualization**
- Learned to interpret relationships and distributions in a multi-class dataset
